\titledquestion{Safety at the Carnival}
  \begin{minipage}{.3\linewidth}
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{height}}
\end{minipage}
  \begin{minipage}{.65\linewidth}
Schmidty \cite{schmidt} has grown old and his vision is weak. He can no longer see if a person meets the height limit. The carnival organizers have installed a sensor to help. It beeps if any of the people in the waiting area is not eligible. Schmidty can move people in and out of the waiting area and then apply the sensor.

  \begin{parts}
  \part A family of 5 is trying to sneak in their toddler who does not meet the limit. Describe how Schmidty can identify the toddler in no more than 3 applications of the sensor.
  \part What is the smallest number of times that Schmidty needs to apply the sensor for a family of size $n$ in which only one person is below the limit. Justify your answer.
  \end{parts}
\end{minipage}
\begin{solution}
    % part I A
    solution:
    Since the applications to use the sensor is limited to three number and there are five people, Schmidty has to make groups of people. There can be a group of three or two people. A sensor will be applied to the group having three people. If there is an alarm, then it means the toddler is in a group of three people. Two people will be checked and if not one of them is the toddler, then it is the third one left. This can be inferred directly and no use of the sensor again. However, if the alarm does not go for the group of three people, then it is for sure the toddler is among the other group. Again the sensor will be checked on either one of the two and if it alarms then the person is the toddler, otherwise the other one.\newline
    
    part II W
    solution:
    If we take examples of the size(n), for instance, 16 people, it takes 4 minimum times to check for a toddler. That is the same as counting how many times it had to be halved. Hence, we can say log base 2 of n can be used to find the minimum number of times that Schmidty needs to apply the sensor for  a family of size n in which only one person is below the limit..
  \end{solution}
